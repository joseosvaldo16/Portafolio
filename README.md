# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! I'm Jose Vera, a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems and extracting insights from data. This portfolio showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of data science.

## Projects

### [Fake News Classifier](Fake_News_Classifier_NLP/)

- **Description**: Implemented a naive Bayes classifier from scratch to differentiate between fake news and real news articles.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Naive Bayes, Natural Language Processing.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying news articles.

### [Internship Projects](Internship_Projects/)

#### [Battery Decision](Internship_Projects/Battery_Decision/)

- **Description**: Investigated various models and methods to improve the F1-score of a previous XGBoost model for battery decision-making. Compared the performance of TabNet with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TabNet, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Improved F1-score by 1% compared to the previous model.

#### [Text Classification](Internship_Projects/Text_Classification/)

- **Description**: Utilized the NLTK library and OpenAI's text embedding API to classify text descriptions from a database into multiple classes, each representing a specific type of issue. Compared deep learning methods with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLTK, Deep Learning, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 75% in text classification.

#### SQl-Chatbot
- **Description**: Developed a chatbot that helps query an SQL database using natural language. The bot uses chatgpt to understand the user's query and then converts it into an SQL query. The query is then executed on the database and the results are returned to the user. As part of the overall query, the chat gpt is use several time to get relevant tables and replace possible misspelled words using a list of keywords.This is useful when queryuing a database with a large number of tables and column cardinality.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, GPT-4, langchain, SQL, sqlite3.


#### [SalesBooking-Chatbot-App](SalesBookingChatBot/readme.md)
- **Description**: Adapted this application to automate the sales booking process by handling user inquiries in natural language. It interprets queries, converts them into SQL statements, and records or retrieves sales information from the database. GPT helps select relevant tables, correct misspellings, and format results. The chatbot dcan be deployed across multiple Azure channels.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Bot Services, Azure App Services, GPT-4, langchain, SQL, sqlite3.
- **Results**: Enhances sales booking by returning precise database records in an average of 5 seconds. Source code is not publicly available but can be shared upon request (with necessary omissions) as it is proprietary.


#### [Mobile Applications](Mobile_Applications/)

##### [Weather App](Mobile_Applications/Weather/)
- **Description**: Developed a simple Yahtzee game using Flutter and Dart. The game allows users to roll dice, score points, and keep track of their scores. The app is available for both Android and iOS devices.
- **Technologies Used**: Flutter, Dart, Rest API(OpenWeatherMap)

##### [Yahtzee Game](Mobile_Applications/Yahtzee/)
- **Description**: Developed a simple Yahtzee game using Flutter and Dart. The game allows users to roll dice, score points, and keep track of their scores. The app is available for both Android and iOS devices.
- **Technologies Used**: Flutter, Dart.
