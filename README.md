# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! I'm Jose Vera, a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems and extracting insights from data. This portfolio showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of data science.

## Projects

### Fake News Classifier

- **Description**: Implemented a naive Bayes classifier from scratch to differentiate between fake news and real news articles.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Naive Bayes, Natural Language Processing.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying news articles.

### Internship Projects

#### Battery Decision

- **Description**: Investigated various models and methods to improve the F1-score of a previous XGBoost model for battery decision-making. Compared the performance of TabNet with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TabNet, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Improved F1-score by 1% compared to the previous model.

#### Text Classification

- **Description**: Utilized the NLTK library and OpenAI's text embedding API to classify text descriptions from a database into multiple classes, each representing a specific type of issue. Compared deep learning methods with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLTK, Deep Learning, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 75% in text classification.
