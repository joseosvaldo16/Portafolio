# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! I'm **Jose(Rafa) Vera**, a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems and extracting insights from data. This portfolio showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of data science and machine learning. Click on the project titles to view the code and details.

## Internship Projects

#### [Battery Decision](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16/Internship_Projects/tree/main/Battery_Decision)
- **Description**: Investigated various models and methods to improve the F1-score of a previous XGBoost model for battery decision-making. Compared the performance of TabNet with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TabNet, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Improved F1-score by 1% compared to the previous model.

#### [Text Classification](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16/Internship_Projects/tree/main/Text_Classification)
- **Description**: Utilized the NLTK library and OpenAI's text embedding API to classify text descriptions from a database into multiple classes, each representing a specific type of issue. Compared deep learning methods with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLTK, Deep Learning, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 75% in text classification.

## Other Projects
#### [SQL-Chatbot](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16/SQL-ChatBot)
- **Description**: Developed a chatbot that helps query an SQL database using natural language. The bot uses chatgpt to understand the user's query and then converts it into an SQL query. The query is then executed on the database and the results are returned to the user. As part of the overall query, the chat gpt is use several time to get relevant tables and replace possible misspelled words using a list of keywords.This is useful when queryuing a database with a large number of tables and column cardinality.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, GPT-4, langchain, SQL, sqlite3.

### [Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16//Fake_News_Classifier_NLP)
- **Description**: Implemented a naive Bayes classifier from scratch to differentiate between fake news and real news articles.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Naive Bayes, Natural Language Processing.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying news articles.


#### - [SalesBooking-Chatbot-App](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16/SalesBookingChatBot)
- **Description**: Adapted this application to automate the sales booking process by handling user inquiries in natural language. It interprets queries, converts them into SQL statements, and records or retrieves sales information from the database. GPT helps select relevant tables, correct misspellings, and format results. The chatbot dcan be deployed across multiple Azure channels.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Bot Services, Azure App Services, GPT-4, langchain, SQL, sqlite3.
- **Results**: Enhances sales booking by returning precise database records in an average of 5 seconds. Source code is not publicly available but can be shared upon request (with necessary omissions) as it is proprietary.


### [Deploying_With_ONNX](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16/Deploying_With_ONNX)
- **Description**: Demonstrated how to deploy a machine learning model using ONNX for inference. This demostrates how a model can be trained in one framework and deployed in another. 
- **Technologies Used**: Python, ONNX, PyTorch.
- **Results**: Successfully deployed a model trained in PyTorch using ONNX for inference.

- **Results**: Enhances sales booking by returning precise database records in an average of 5 seconds.

### [PDF_Data_Extraction](https://github.com/joseosvaldo16/PDF_Data_Extaction)
- **Description**: Extracted data from PDF files using PDFMiner, and pytesseract. The extracted data was then used to create a pandas dataframe.  This demonstrates how to extract data from PDF files both text based and image(scanned) based. GPT is then used to extract knowledge from the text based data in a formatted way.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, PDFMiner, pytesseract, GPT-4, pandas.
- **Results**: Successfully extracted data from PDF files and created a pandas dataframe.
