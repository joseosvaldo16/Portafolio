# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! I'm Jose Vera, a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems and extracting insights from data. This portfolio showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of data science.

## Projects

### Fake News Classifier

- **Description**: Implemented a naive Bayes classifier from scratch to differentiate between fake news and real news articles.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Naive Bayes, Natural Language Processing.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying news articles.

### Internship Projects

#### Battery Decision

- **Description**: Investigated various models and methods to improve the F1-score of a previous XGBoost model for battery decision-making. Compared the performance of TabNet with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TabNet, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Improved F1-score by 1% compared to the previous model.

#### Text Classification

- **Description**: Utilized the NLTK library and OpenAI's text embedding API to classify text descriptions from a database into multiple classes, each representing a specific type of issue. Compared deep learning methods with XGBoost.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLTK, Deep Learning, XGBoost.
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 75% in text classification.

#### SQl-Chatbot
- **Description**: Developed a chatbot that helps query an SQL database using natural language. The bot uses chatgpt to understand the user's query and then converts it into an SQL query. The query is then executed on the database and the results are returned to the user. As part of the overall query, the chat gpt is use several time to get relevant tables and replace possible misspelled words using a list of keywords.This is useful when queryuing a database with a large number of tables and column cardinality.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, GPT-4, langchain, SQL, sqlite3.

#### SQL-Chatbot-App
- **Description**: Leveraged the Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Bot Services, and Azure App Services, to create a chatbot application that can query SQL database using natural language through an intuitive and responsive web chat interface. The chatbot is able to understand the user's query, convert it into an SQL query, execute the query on the database, and return the results to the user. The app uses gpt to generate SQL queries, get most relevant tables, replac misspelled words, and generate proper headers for the query results. The application can be deployed to multiple channels on Azure.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Bot Services, Azure App Services, GPT-4, langchain, SQL, sqlite3.
- **Results**: The chatbot application is able to query an SQL database using natural language and return the results to the user through an intuitive and responsive web chat interface.Response time averages around 5 seconds depnding on the complexity of the query, and the length of the response. Source code is not publicaly available, but can be provided upon request with some redaction as this is a proprietary project of Midtronics.
